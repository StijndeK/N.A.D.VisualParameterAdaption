# N.A.D.
N.A.D. is a research project to improve the process of designing non-linear audio for games. Mockups, prototypes and experiments will serve to further investigate a tool that improves this process. 

My workflow, creativity and (interdisciplinary) team communication and that of other game audio designers is obstructed in the process of designing and testing non-linear music systems for games, which can be cumbersome due to technical limitations caused by the non-linearity of video games in relation to the linearity of standard audio production software. Standard linear audio production tools offer little to none non-linear sequencing, transitioning, parameter adaption and probability functionalities. Furthermore, linear sequencers struggle to provide a visual representation of non-linear systems. These issues cause testing and prototyping to take unnecessary amounts of time and obscures communication with collaborators. This obstructs the workflow and discourages innovation. Existing standard middleware solutions focus less on tackling the obstructions in the design stage of a project. New solutions in the form of tools and methods can be developed to tackle these issues and upgrade the process of designing non-linear audio for games.

## Current status

## Application to games
Experiments are applied to multiple projects are currently being developed. Prototypes include a link containing a video of the application of the prototype to the project:
